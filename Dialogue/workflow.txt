# Co-op Narrative Writer Workflow

## 🎯 Goal
Build branching, asynchronous dialogue for two players using structured JSON.

---

## ✍️ Writing Rules

- Use one top-level node per dialogue moment.
- Use unique keys for each node (e.g. `"start_forest"`, `"p1_look_left"`)
- Provide both `text_p1` and `text_p2` to support independent screens.
- Branching uses `choices_p1` and `choices_p2` arrays.
- Each choice has `text` and a `next` target node.

## 🧩 Optional Keys

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `sync_point` | Forces both players to hit "Continue" before advancing |
| `triggers` | Animates UI, gives items, opens systems |

---

## 🧪 Trigger Reference

| Trigger | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `"reveal_map"` | Shows the shared map icon |
| `"give_item_sword"` | Gives a sword to the triggering player |
| `"unlock_gate"` | Sets the `gate_unlocked` global flag |
